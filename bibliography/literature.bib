  abstract = 	 {Tandem mass spectrometry is the only high-throughput method for analyzing the protein content of complex biological samples and is thus the primary technology driving the growth of the field of proteomics. A key outstanding challenge in this field involves identifying the sequence of amino acids -the peptide- responsible for generating each observed spectrum, without making use of prior knowledge in the form of a peptide sequence database. Although various machine learning methods have been developed to address this de novo sequencing problem, challenges that arise when modeling tandem mass spectra have led to complex models that combine multiple neural networks and post-processing steps. We propose a simple yet powerful method for de novo peptide sequencing, Casanovo, that uses a transformer framework to map directly from a sequence of observed peaks (a mass spectrum) to a sequence of amino acids (a peptide). Our experiments show that Casanovo achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset using a standard cross-species evaluation framework which involves testing with spectra with never-before-seen peptide labels. Casanovo not only achieves superior performance but does so at a fraction of the model complexity and inference time required by other methods.}

\section{Uncovering the Dark Proteome: Comparison with MaxQuant}

A primary objective of this study was to evaluate the extent to which \textit{de novo} peptide sequencing can expand the identification landscape beyond the limitations of database-driven methods. By comparing our results with those obtained via MaxQuant (MQ), we can quantify the "dark matter" of the proteome—spectra that contain high-quality information but remain unidentified by traditional search engines.

\subsection{Unique Peptide Identifications}

The comparison of unique peptide sequences identified by both methods reveals a substantial expansion of the detectable proteome. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:unique_peps}, the \textit{de novo} approach identified approximately 40,000 unique peptides that were also found by MaxQuant, demonstrating high consistency in the "known" space. 

\begin{figure}[H] 
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{plots/results/uniquePeps.png}
    \caption{Overlap of unique peptide identifications between the proposed \textit{de novo} model and MaxQuant. The model successfully recovers the majority of MQ identifications while contributing 40,000 additional unique sequences.}
    \label{fig:unique_peps}
\end{figure}

Crucially, the model discovered an additional 40,000 unique peptides that were entirely absent from the MQ results. Conversely, only a negligible fraction (approximately 30 peptides) was identified by MQ but missed by our model, indicating that the \textit{de novo} approach covers nearly the entire search space of the database-driven method while doubling the number of unique sequences.

\subsection{Identification of Previously Unidentified Spectra}

The true potential of the model is reflected at the spectrum level (PSMs). In the analyzed dataset, MaxQuant provided identifications for 1,510,866 spectra. Our model was able to provide high-confidence sequences for a significant portion of the remaining "dark" spectra:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High-Confidence Matches (Score $> 0.8$):} We identified 446,290 additional spectra with a confidence score above 0.8. Based on our previous alignment validation, this score range corresponds to highly reliable peptide sequences.
    \item \textbf{Precursor-Shifted Matches (Score $-0.2 < s < 0$):} Interestingly, we found 231,208 spectra in a score range that indicates high sequencing confidence but carries a penalty ($-1$) due to a precursor mass mismatch. These spectra likely represent peptides with unexpected modifications or amino acid substitutions (SNPs) that shift the precursor mass beyond the tolerance of the theoretical database entry, yet yield clear fragmentation patterns.
\end{itemize}

Summing these categories, the \textit{de novo} approach provides plausible sequence candidates for over 670,000 spectra that were previously discarded in the MQ workflow. This substantial increase in spectral utilization highlights the model's ability to move beyond the "closed-search" paradigm.

\subsection{From Global Discovery to Specific Variants}

The identification of these additional sequences suggests that the "dark proteome" in these glioma samples is rich in biological variants. The high number of high-confidence predictions that do not perfectly match the database entries—especially those with slight precursor shifts—points towards the presence of non-canonical protein isoforms. In the following sections, we will categorize these findings into specific biological phenomena, namely novel phosphorylation sites (p-sites) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
