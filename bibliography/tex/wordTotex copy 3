2.3 Deep Learning and Transformer Models in Proteomics
The limitations of rule-based de novo sequencing approaches motivated the adoption of deep learning methods, which learn peptide fragmentation patterns directly from data. By leveraging large annotated MS/MS datasets, neural networks can model complex, instrument-specific fragmentation behavior and generalize across varying experimental conditions. This data-driven paradigm marked a fundamental shift in de novo peptide sequencing.
2.3.1 A new Modeling approach for De Novo Sequencing
The transition to deep learning enabled the modeling of de novo sequencing as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) task, translating spectral peak patterns into amino acid sequences. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used to extract local spectral features, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as LSTMs, modeled sequential dependencies between amino acids.
 Although these models outperformed classical methods in many settings, they exhibited limitations in capturing long-range dependencies and global spectral context, particularly for longer peptides or spectra with sparse fragmentation.
2.3.2 Transformer Architecture and Self-Attention
The introduction of the Transformer architecture addressed many of these limitations by replacing recurrence with self-attention mechanisms. Self-attention allows the model to assess relationships between all spectral features simultaneously, enabling the integration of complementary evidence such as b- and y-ion pairs distributed across the full m/z range.
 In proteomics, this capability is especially beneficial, as peptide evidence is often fragmented and non-local. The Casanovo model was a landmark application of Transformers to de novo peptide sequencing, employing an encoder–decoder architecture to autoregressively predict peptide sequences. By combining global spectral context with precursor mass constraints and beam search decoding, Casanovo achieved state-of-the-art performance.
2.3.3 Spectrum Encoding and Embedding
A critical component of Transformer-based models is the encoding of MS/MS spectra into suitable input representations. Typically, spectra are transformed into fixed-length embeddings that incorporate m/z values, intensities, and positional information. These embeddings serve as the input tokens for the Transformer encoder, enabling the model to learn fragmentation-aware representations.
 Effective spectrum encoding is essential for robust performance, as it directly influences how well the model can distinguish informative peaks from noise and account for variations in fragmentation patterns.
2.3.4 Autoregressive Sequence Generation and Beam Search
Most modern de novo sequencing models generate peptide sequences autoregressively, predicting one amino acid at a time conditioned on previously predicted residues and the encoded spectrum. Beam search is commonly applied during inference to explore multiple high-probability candidate sequences simultaneously.
 This strategy allows the model to balance local confidence with global sequence plausibility, while enforcing constraints such as precursor mass consistency. As a result, autoregressive decoding with beam search significantly improves identification accuracy, particularly in ambiguous or noisy spectra.
Following Casanovo, several models have expanded the capabilities of de novo sequencing. DeepNovo pioneered the use of CNNs for feature extraction, while InstaNovo and π-Prime focused on increasing inference speed through non-autoregressive or optimized architectures. To address the limitation of sparse PTM support in early models, Modanovo extended the token vocabulary to include a broad range of amino acid-PTM combinations, demonstrating that Transformers can scale to biologically diverse datasets.
Despite these advances, a significant gap remains regarding Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomics.
