\subsection{Modification Distribution and Heatmap Analysis}
To evaluate the coverage of the training data, we visualized the modification density across different residues. This approach was closely oriented towards the \textit{Modanovo} framework to ensure comparability and systematic evaluation of PTM-residue pairs \cite{KlaprothAndrade2025}.

\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps_combined}, the current data selection strategy provides high coverage for common PTMs such as Oxidation (M) and Phosphorylation (S, T, Y). However, there remains significant optimization potential. Specifically, certain rare PTM-residue combinations or complex multiplexed modifications (e.g., Ubiquitinylation + TMT) exhibit lower spectral counts, which might limit the model's ability to generalize on extremely sparse clinical samples.

\section{Model Training and Convergence}

The model was trained until the validation loss showed early signs of stagnation, indicating the onset of overfitting. Convergence was reached after 13 epochs, corresponding to approximately 1,550,000 training steps. To assess the final performance, the model state at this checkpoint was utilized for inference on the complete, independent test dataset.

\section{Performance Evaluation on the test set}

To evaluate the predictive confidence, precision-coverage curves were generated for the different PTM categories and stratified by TMT  vs non-TMT data.  The performance is quantified using the Area Under the Precision-Coverage Curve (AUPCC).

Colors represent the performance of the final model on TMT-labeled (orange) and non-TMT (blue) spectra. Unmodified non-TMT peptides are shown in light grey for comparison.}

\subsection{Comparative Performance: Non-TMT and Modanovo Baseline}

A key requirement for the expanded model was to maintain high performance on standard (non-TMT) data, ensuring that the addition of TMT-related features did not degrade general sequencing accuracy. On non-TMT unmodified peptides, the model achieved an AUPCC of 0.92, which is highly consistent with the performance reported for the Modanovo architecture (AUPCC of 0.93) \cite{Yilmaz2022}.

This stability is further reflected in the specific PTM performance. For instance, the model demonstrated similar accuracy for Phosphorylation on non-TMT data (AUPCC 0.95) staying aligned with the general Modanovo median for phosphorylation (0.93--0.96 depending on the residue) \cite{Yilmaz2022}. Similarly, high performance was observed for Pyro-Glu (AUPCC 0.95), likely due to its restricted occurrence at the peptide N-terminus, a pattern the model successfully internalizes. In contrast, O-Glycosylation (S/T[+203.079]) remains a significant challenge with an AUPCC of 0.39, mirroring the difficulties reported in literature due to low training examples and complex fragmentation \cite{Yilmaz2022}.

Modanovo: A Unified Model for PTM-Aware de Novo Sequencing 
ProteomeTools project (34)). The latter includes synthetic peptides modified with a range of 
biologically relevant post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, 
acetylation, ubiquitylation, and methylation, which were crucially missing in MassIVE-KB 
(v1). Due to the scarcity of large, well-annotated experimental datasets covering diverse 
PTMs, this combination allowed us to leverage both data from in vivo experiments as well as 
from synthetic peptides to improve model generalization. In total, this combined dataset, 
denoted as development dataset throughout this manuscript, consisted of approximately 11 
million PSMs spanning 20 canonical amino acids and 19 distinct PTM-amino acid 
combinations, 12 of them not being covered by Casanovo and most of its successor models 
(Fig. 1A, B, Supplementary Table 1), enabling comprehensive learning and evaluation 
across a broad spectrum of peptide modifications. 
Modanovo extends Casanovo to 12 new amino acid-PTM combinations 
Based on this development dataset, we developed Modanovo, a transformer-based model 
designed to identify modified peptides directly from tandem mass spectra. To enable this, we 
fine-tuned Casanovo’s transformer architecture (Fig. 1C), initializing the model with weights 
from a Casanovo model previously trained on MassIVE-KB (v1). To accommodate the 
expanded vocabulary arising from PTM-amino acid combinations treated as distinct tokens, 
we adjusted the shapes of the input embedding layer and the final linear projection layer 
(Methods). The new parameters corresponding to the expanded token set were initialized by 
averaging the weights of existing tokens in their respective layers, providing a meaningful 
starting point rather than random initialization. We then fine-tuned the entire model 
end-to-end, allowing it to retain knowledge of canonical peptide fragmentation patterns while 
adapting to the variability introduced by PTMs.

Modanovo confidently identifies modified synthetic peptides 
We first assessed whether Modanovo’s performance remained comparable to that of 
Casanovo on unmodified peptides and the PTMs covered by Casanovo, which served as the 
starting point of our fine-tuning approach for PTM expansion. Specifically, we evaluated both 
models on the test set of the MassIVE-KB (v1) dataset, which was also used to originally 
develop and evaluate Casano

4.2.2 Generalization on TMT-Labeled Data 
The global performance on TMT data (AUPCC 0.89) is slightly lower than on non-TMT data (AUPCC 0.92), reflecting the increased spectral complexity in troduced by the chemical labels. 
Specific findings for TMT-labeled PTMs include: 
• Ubiquitination and Monomethylation: Interestingly, the model per formed slightly better on TMT-labeled Ubiquitination (AUPCC 0.95) com pared to its non-TMT counterpart (AUPCC 0.94). For Monomethylation, the gap was even more pronounced (TMT: 0.94 vs. non-TMT: 0.82), sug gesting that the systematic mass shifts provided by TMT might aid in dis tinguishing these specific modifications in certain contexts. 
• Acetylation: Performance remained robust across both categories (TMT: 0.91 vs. non-TMT: 0.92), indicating that Acetylation is identified with high confidence regardless of the labeling strategy.
