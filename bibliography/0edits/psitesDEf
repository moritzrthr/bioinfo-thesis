METHODS:you do need something about the p-sites: how do you defined them/evaluate them etc


we need to add smthg before the sepctral evidence thing about the psites

we took the peptides unmodifided version mapped to the proteome/their proteins
then we looked at the predictions to see all the modifcations
then we saw if there was a phsosporylation predicted either from mqxquant or modanovoTMT or both we took the index of the position in peptide and using the alignment mapped it back to the global protein position

we can then validate those by seeing how many unique peptides gave evidence for the p site and how the scores and alsignment was moreover we lookde into literature existing research
